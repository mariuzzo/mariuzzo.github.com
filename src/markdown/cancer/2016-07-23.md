It has been a while since the last time I wrote. On Monday 11th, I had my 5th chemo and I started to use _Vincristine_ instead of _Vinblastine_. After that I had the common side effects of the chemo. Although, the Vincristine seems to be more adverse causing a weird taste in my mouth for at least a week. Anyway, since 3 days ago I have been feeling better, but not for too long, **next Tuesday I will have my 6th chemo**.
