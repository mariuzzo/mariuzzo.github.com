All right! Today was my 10th chemo! Got a few issues getting the _Vincristine_ because it was out of stock at the hospital. We had to drive to another hospital to buy it. Thanks Jehovah, we got it there!

Apart from that, I learnt that _Vinblastine_ is back on market, again. Let see, if I can reschedule a meeting with my doctor and see if we can get _Vinblastine_ instead of _Vincristine_.

**Two more to go!**
