I went to see my doctor this morning for a post-check. She recommended me (again) to rest for 7 day starting today (until next Friday). I explained to her the nature of my job, and she told to not push my self.

Next Tuesday, I may get the results of this biopsy to see if it is something serious (Hodgkin's Lymphoma) that need immediate attention or not. I will keep us posted as always.
