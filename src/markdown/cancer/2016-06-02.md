Today, I will have my first [blood test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test). I have to do that after the 2nd dose of chemo for each [cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABVD#Administration) then bring the results to my doctor.

I will have the results in a few hours. I will post an update tomorrow.
