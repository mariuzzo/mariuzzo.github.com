This chemo session was good. Although there were some issues with the drainpipes, I didn't feel any kind of pain regarding the [Dacarbazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacarbazine).

Today, I'm driving back home. Just so you know, that after a chemo session I'm not dead. But upon I touch home, I'm dead sleep. ðŸ’¤
