On Thursday 5th, August 2021, at 5:30pm, while resting at home I felt a bit unwell. Mimi took my temperature and **I was having a fever of 38.5C** (101.3F) ü§í. I took _painkillers_ to control the fever and wait a couple of minutes. After 20 minutes, **the fever went to 39.0C** (102.2F). We decided to call ER oncology. The conversation over the phone was:

> - **Mimi:** I have a patient that had chemo 8 days ago and is having a fever of 39.0C.
> - **ER:** He should come here. However, there are a lot of patients in queue. But he should come anyway.
> - **Mimi:** Can we visit another ER (non oncology)?
> - **ER:** No, cancer patients are only treated here.

With no _‚Äòmany‚Äô_ options, a neighbor came to brought us to the ER oncology. Before leaving, **the fever went to 39.5C** (103.1F). We arrived in less than 30 mins. At the ER, every cubicles were full and 2 other patients were in queue waiting for attention. A couple of minutes after arriving, a nurse came asking about the _‚Äòpatient with the fever‚Äô_. She did a few routine checks on me, and took my temperature. It was 39.5C (103.1F).

One fair disadvantage that I have is that I'm usually the younger looking among others patients. The 2 other patients that were before me, was a lady in her sixties in a wheelchair and there was a man in his seventy also in a wheelchair. And I was there walking. For us, it is normal, understandable and considerate to let older patient be attended before me.

Mimi and me wasn't alone. My mother, my step-dad and my parents in law were there supporting us ü•∞. I felt very grateful to have all of them with us.

## Inside the ER cubicle

After 2 hours, I was admitted to the ER. By that time, **the fever went down to 38.0C** (100.4F) approx. The doctor and nurse ran more checks on me. Then a nurse inserted an intravenous catheter into one of my veins and then administered me [Paracetamol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol) (a medication used to treat fever). Because my veins are damaged, the drip was super slow.

A couple of minutes later, a phlebotomist appeared to extract blood from my veins. However, after looking for a proper vein she couldn't find any. At that moment, the phlebotomist told the doctor that she will proceed to extract **arterial blood** and she repeated that to me. I didn't understood that wasn't just a message, but a warning. She punctured my body 5 times, to be able to get an arterial blood sample. Most of these punctures were painful.

In the end, everything went fine at the ER. After examining my blood **they indicated me a treatment for [febrile neutropenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Febrile_neutropenia)**. It consisted of 3 days on: painkillers, antibiotics and [Filgrastim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filgrastim) (a medication used to treat low neutrophil count). Also, I didn't get admitted in the hospital, they allowed me to go home that same day. We left around 11:00pm.

## About arterial blood

A few days later, I did some research about **‚Äúarterial blood‚Äù**. The motivation was to understand if the pain that I had was to be expected. The [<abbr title="University of California San Francisco">UCSF</abbr> says](https://www.ucsfhealth.org/medical-tests/arterial-stick):

> **Puncture of an artery may be more uncomfortable than puncture of a vein.** This is because arteries are deeper than veins. Arteries also have thicker walls and have more nerves.
>
> When the needle is inserted, there may be some discomfort or pain. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.

That was enough to be convinced that the pain that I experimented was to be expected. Also, I think the [<abbr title="Chemotherapy-induced Peripheral Neuropathy">CIPN</abbr>](https://www.healthline.com/health/cancer/neuropathy-from-chemo) increased the pain, because of the damage on peripheral nerves. But, I'm not a doctor. I will ask my doctor about it on my next appointment.
