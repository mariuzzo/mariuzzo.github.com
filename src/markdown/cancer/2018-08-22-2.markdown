Yes, I'm still alive. I'm one of the priviledged one that can live after death.

I have visited the doctors several times since my last chemo, and she said there's no trace of Hodgkin. However, my body isn't the same, I still feel weak, have headache, backache, sore throat, pain in the mouth, pain in my right knee, an injury in the perineum and so on. Ah, forgot to mention weird patterns in my tongue.

I don't want to thin further as it steal my little energy that is on my body.
