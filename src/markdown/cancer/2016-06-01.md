I apologize for not keeping my word on having this blog updated daily since my 2nd chemotherapy. I was completely distracted with the “friendly” side effects of the chemo.

Basically, I had the same mix of side effects as the first one. I have to admit, this 2nd round of chemo was more easy to manage than the first one. The side effects were the same except that I felt less burning in my right arm.
