Today, I continue with the remaining tests:

- ğŸ‘Œ 2 blood tests.
- ğŸ‘Œ Pending stool test. ğŸ’©
- ğŸ‘Œ An echocardiogram (the doctor said my heart looks OK).

I have 3 holes in each arms because of injections ğŸ˜‚. I will drink a lot of beet juice (I heard often that red-natural drinks are good for blood).

My pelvic bone still hurt a little, the doctor said that I would feel pain for 2-3 days. It feels like my bone was fractured.
