title: 'Blood from veins in the foot'

This morning, I had blood tests for my upcoming doctor appointment. As my veins are damaged I expected for the phlebotomist to have a bad time finding a proper vein. After 15 minutes, with two phlebotomists looking for a vein they suggested for [arterial blood](/cancer/2021-08-05). My immediate reaction was: “No, no please” 🙅‍♂️. They examined my feet, and **they found a vein in right foot**. First time having blood sample extracted from a foot.
