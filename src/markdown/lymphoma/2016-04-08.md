I got my first visit to the new public hospital. I had a _rendez-vous_ with a new haematologist. Everything went great.

Thanks to Jehovah that I found a spiritual sister in that Hospital fighting with stage II breast cancer. She had a positive attitude which encouraged me and gave me some hints […]

When I went to see the haematologist, she suggested the same treatment as the other one (that was a good sign!). Later, she ordered 3 tests to determine the stage of my illness:

1.  Several blood tests.
2.  A Bone marrow biopsy.
3.  Four tomographies.

Before leaving she told me that I have a "good" diagnosis, meaning that my illness has a good response to current treatments compared to other cancers.

Also, she asked me about my insurance (months ago I mysteriously discovered that I have government-subsidized insurance apart from my private one) then I told her that I have government-subsidized insurance (the same as my sis), then she replied:

> “Ok, it covers the costs of the treatment up to 100% including tests, studies and medications”. 😍

You don't need to ask me how relieved I felt and keep feeling because of these words. In my family, I'm the only one who works to get money, because both my wife and I work as volunteers. Thanks God!

After that we went home… That day I paid: $0.
