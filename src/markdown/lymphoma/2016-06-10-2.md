I don't like to be negative. Today, I got my 3rd dose of chemo and it was **painful, stressful and crumbling**. As you may notice, in the beginning of this week I got a **Neutropenia** which mean my white blood cells count was very low, under the reference range. Also, I injected myself with **Filgrastim** to estimulate the bone marrow to produce the needed white blood cells, and cover the loss. All this, produced me a high fever that started at the end of the chemo dose which I didn't detected. I was feeling really frozen I got a white shirt under my t-shirt plus a jacket. The nurse gave me a coat, and my wife gave me another one. Even with all these things covering me, I was trembling of cold.

Then it wasn't until I get home that I used a thermometer to check my temperature under my armpit, it was: 39.4C which is considered as a high fever ([taking the temp under the armpit is less accurate than oral or rectal](http://www.webmd.com/first-aid/fever-in-adults-treatment#1)).

I was feeling dizzy. I just wanted to be layed down on my bed. My extraordinary give me Acetaminophen, she prepared me an all natural soup with potatoes and carrots, she also prepared a tea with Jamaica Flowers, onions, lemon and honey, and she prepared lemon juice with honey and Fruit Passion juice. Indeed, the fever started going down from 39.4C to 38.6C then it continued going down to 37.8 and finally 36.3C. _Woohoo!_

Today, the word of Jehovah God came to my mind (one that most of us has recently read):

**[Psalm 30:1-5](https://www.jw.org/finder?wtlocale=E&pub=nwtsty&srctype=wol&bible=19030001&srcid=share)**:

> I will exalt you, O Jehovah, for **you have lifted me up**;
> You did not let my enemies rejoice over me.
>
> 2 O Jehovah my God, **I cried to you for help, and you healed me**.
>
> 3 O Jehovah, **you have lifted me up from the Grave**.
> You kept me alive; you spared me from sinking into the pit.
>
> 4 Sing praises to Jehovah, you his loyal ones,
> **Give thanks to his holy name**;
>
> 5 Because being under his anger is only for a moment,
> But **being in his favor is for a lifetime**.
> Weeping may come in the evening, but **in the morning, there is a joyful cry**.

Bold are mine.
