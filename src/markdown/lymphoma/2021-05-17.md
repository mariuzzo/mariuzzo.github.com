I received and compared the blood count results from last saturday. **Red blood cells, haemoglobin and hematocrit, as expected, are low and going down**. However, for some reason white blood cells increased a bit. Also, my platelets are still increasing and surpassed the limit of 400-450. After some research, this seems to be a "reactive thrombocytosis" which means my body is producing more platelets due to a reason, which we still don't know. In the following spreadsheet you can see all my blood count from this year.

**Green** = increased compared to previous count.

**Yellow** = decreases compared to previous count. White = no change

Today, I'm writing from the hospital. I have two appointments: haematology and gastroenterology. More on that in another post.
