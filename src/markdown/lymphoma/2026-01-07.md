Yesterday and today I had follow-up appointments regarding my [Port-a-Cath](/lymphoma/2025-12-02) implantation. I completed the following:

- Chest Radiography.
- Echocardiogram strain.
- Pre-operative blood tests.
- Cardiology consultation.
- Anesthesia consultation.

The next step is to visit the surgeon to schedule the Port-a-Cath implantation procedure. The scheduled date is January 15th.

Recently, I have been praying for wisdom and calmness. And I received them.
