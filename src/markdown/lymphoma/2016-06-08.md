title: Injecting myself with Filgrastim

Today, I accomplished a goal: **injecting myself with Filgrastim**. My wife was excited to also inject me, but in the end I was more excited and I decided to do it myself. And, in case of emergency (losing consciousness) she will do it instead.

We recorded a video of my "brave" and "manly" reaction 😂.
