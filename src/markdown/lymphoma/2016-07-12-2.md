_What a day!_ How should I start? … We woke up at 6AM and we went to the hospital to have the 5th chemo. Two weeks ago, when we went for the 4th dose there was a problem with one of the chemotherapy components (vinblastine). Today, there was no _Vinblastine_ at all in the hospital, neither in other hospitals, foundations, pharmacies, or pharmaceuticals. _Vinblastine_ Apocalypse! There was no V in the whole country… Of course, we spent the whole morning looking for it, my both families too, also the doctor and nurses. I don't need to say more; _Vinblastine_ seems to be gone here. My doctor pointed out the following history fact:

> In the past there was a Vinblastine crisis that lasted 2 years…

ಠ_ಠ ← That was exactly my face.

It was 12PM already. At that time I was supposed to be finishing with the dose, but I hadn't even started it. Then the doctor says that we could replace the _Vinblastine_ with [Vincristine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincristine). Nice, a new flavor for the cocktail!

We went to eat something, then we purchased the _Vincristine_ (because it wasn't under the insurance approval). Having everything, we started the chemo at 3PM and we finished 5hrs later… 7PM. That's what I call a day!

I'm very grateful that we were able to find a viable alternative. I'm thinking about people in other places in this world who can't get any of these treatments… I'm thinking like that not because I have Hodgkin, but because I have seen the good will of some people like my personal doctor and the nurses, and I have also seen the reality of new things. For example, the doctor explained that one possible reason that we don't have _Vinblastine_ is because it is one of the cheapest meds, and pharmaceuticals don't sell too much. Yes, that sucks! I know they are not a charity institute, they are a business. But we are all humans.

Anyway, focusing on the bad things will not solve anything. I decided to focus my attention on how things went well for us. I strongly believe that Jehovah God had a role in this, because He has helped me to have a good attitude towards things in life. And many scientists and doctors have proved that a good attitude has a good influence on us. We, my wife and I, also proved that [attitude makes a difference](https://www.jw.org/finder?docid=102016002&wtlocale=E&srcid=share)!

I would like to conclude this post with a Bible proverb that states:

> “A joyful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit saps one’s strength.” ([Proverbs 17:22](https://www.jw.org/en/publications/bible/nwt/books/proverbs/17/#v20017022))
