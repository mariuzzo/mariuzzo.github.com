Yesterday, I went to the lab for blood tests. Today, I got the results and I read them all. The relevant part is that my white cells, red cells, hemoglobin, and hematocrit are below the reference range. Which means I have a low blood count.

That's not something weird to me, because I had two chemos [IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy). The components of that chemo are irritants.

Let's see what my doctor (the haematologist) says next Monday.
