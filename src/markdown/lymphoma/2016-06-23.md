It is 01:24 AM right now. Before going to bed I want to write down all about my recent visit to my doctor.

- **I asked about the fever I got during the injection of the Dacarbazine (the D in ABVD) on my 3rd chemo.**

  She said some patients get fever due to the huge amount of Dacarbazine. If the fever goes away on its own then it is nothing serious.

- **I showed the armpit lump to her**

  It is not a swollen lymph node. It is more like a [cyst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst). She gave me an indication and explained how to heal it (which I suspect means we are preparing it to pop… _ewww_).

- **I also showed my little swollen gum to her**

  Could be possibly caused by the way I _violently_ brush my teeth. 😅

- **If I catch a flu, what should I do?**

  Try to cure it. I can use meds for flu. I thought I wasn't allowed to.

That was good news to me. Later, in the morning I will get my 4th dose of chemo.
