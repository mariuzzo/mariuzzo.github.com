Today, I continue with the remaining tests:

- 👌 2 blood tests.
- 👌 Pending stool test. 💩
- 👌 An echocardiogram (the doctor said my heart looks OK).

I have 3 holes in each arm because of injections 😂. I will drink a lot of beet juice (I've often heard that red-natural drinks are good for blood).

My pelvic bone still hurts a little. The doctor said that I would feel pain for 2-3 days. It feels like my bone was fractured.
