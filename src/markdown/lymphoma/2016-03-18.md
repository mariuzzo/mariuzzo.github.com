I went to see my doctor this morning for a post-check. She recommended (again) that I rest for 7 days starting today (until next Friday). I explained to her the nature of my job, and she told me not to push myself.

Next Tuesday, I may get the results of this biopsy to see if it is something serious (Hodgkin's Lymphoma) that needs immediate attention or not. I will keep you posted as always.
