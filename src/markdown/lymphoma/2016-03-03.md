Today, I went to the doctor (an otorhinolaryngologist) and I brought to her the results of my lymph node biopsy. The results says it could be a **lymphoma**.

The doctor made an urgent appointment to an haematologist by tomorrow. Next week I have to visit 3 different doctors: an anaesthesiologist and a cardiologist for surgery preparation, then after that I need to visit again my otorhinolaryngologist. All of this is to schedule a surgery in 2 weeks.

The surgery is to extract an entire lymph node from my neck. The sample will be analysed locally, then it will be send to the US for a more complete analysis (immunohistochemistry). The conclusions will led us to know what I could have, and what possible solutions exists.
