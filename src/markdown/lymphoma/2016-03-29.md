Today, I got the results from the last biopsy (surgery). It suggests to be: “[Nodular sclerosis Hodgkin disease](http://www.lls.org/lymphoma/hodgkin-lymphoma/diagnosis/hodgkin-lymphoma-subtypes)”.

Tomorrow, I will start the process to do a _[immunohistochemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry)_, and after that I will obtain more information from the haematologist.
