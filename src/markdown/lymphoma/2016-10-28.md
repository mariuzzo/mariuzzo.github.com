I'm glad to announce that **I completed the last chemo** from the last session.

It was a _loooong_ (more than 6 months) journey with ups and downs. I learnt so much about myself and life. I felt the hand of Jehovah God throughout all the processes, not only because I finished, but because of the strength I had to endure all of this with a truly positive attitude.

Now, I will be able to join my congregation physically after 1 month from now. Also, during the next 3 months my doctors will check on me to see if the cancer is really gone, or if it's still there.

💪💪💪
