title: Fine & Tired

Today, I feel fine. A little bit tired because of being in bed all day during the last week. My arm still hurts a bit, particularly my hand. I have noticed that if I make some kind of movements with my hand it hurts and I immediately feel the burn coming. Things like scratching my body make my affected hand tired.

However, I'm feeling good! My wife and I have been more focused on living even more healthily, having a reasonable balance.

These days I'm using a medical face mask when I open a window or when I go outside to take a sun bath.
