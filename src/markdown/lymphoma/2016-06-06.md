Today, I went to my doctor. I have to bring the blood test results, and (if all good) I will get the indication of the 2nd chemo cycle (next 2 doses).

My doctor checked the blood test results and she said I have a [neutropenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia). In a few words, that's low concentration of a type of white blood cells (neutrophils).

To avoid interrupting the chemotherapy, the doctor prescribed me 2 injections of [Filgrastim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filgrastim) to estimulate my bone marrow to product more white blood cells.

Apart from that, the doctor checked my lymph nodes and... **I don't have any swollen lymph nodes!** My neck is back to normal.

Thanks Jehovah! Thanks to all who collaborated in the treatment too.
