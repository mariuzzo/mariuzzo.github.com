Today, I received the results of the _immunohistochemistry_ from the US. **The answer is that I have: “[Hodgkin disease, Nodular sclerosis type](http://www.lls.org/lymphoma/hodgkin-lymphoma/diagnosis/hodgkin-lymphoma-subtypes)”** (aka Hodgkin's Lymphoma).

I went straight to the haematologist, in a private health center, to get details about possible treatments. But, I quit the private health center because their “policy” can’t tell or give an idea to the patient on how much the treatment cost… totally absurd.

I remembered something that I read and studied that says:

> ‘in this greedy world, there are those who seize on people’s illness as an opportunity to make money’.

That give me a hint, I went to a new public hospital dedicated to oncology. And I'm having my next visit with a new haematologist [this Friday (in 2 days)](/lymphoma/2016-04-08).
