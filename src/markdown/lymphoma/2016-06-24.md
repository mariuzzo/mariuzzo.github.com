Today, I went for my 4th dose of [ABVD chemo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABVD). Unfortunately, the _Vinblastine_ (**V** from [ABVD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABVD)) was out of stock, but… there was only one 10mg bottle and I needed 6mg. Thanks to Jehovah that I got it for me. But, as I said, 'unfortunately' for any other person who would need that same kind of medicine for today. I asked the nurse what would happen if in a next dose, there's one component missing. She explained multiple ways of getting it via foundations or another hospital. Phew! I'm prepared in case it affects us again.

About this dose, **it was the best**, almost no pain, no freeze, no fever, all good! I just got more dark stains on my hands and feet. As I said, that's just a cosmetic side effect. Nothing to worry about. 😛

Now, I'm writing this from home. I'm feeling normal, just a little bit of fatigue, nothing serious. I have already drunk 2L of water, and I will continue for the rest of the night. **Drinking a lot of water is a way to protect my body, by doing this I'm forcing my system to drain the toxicity of the chemo cocktail.**

That's it for today! Last thing, today I was reading these comforting words:

> **[Psalm 46:1](https://www.jw.org/finder?wtlocale=E&pub=nwtsty&srctype=wol&bible=19046001&srcid=share):** God is our refuge and strength,
> A help that is readily found in times of distress.
