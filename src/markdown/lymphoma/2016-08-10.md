Today, I completed the 7th out of 12 chemos. I started at 9:30AM and finished by approx. 2:00PM. Yup, **the duration was more than 5 hours without interruption**.

While getting the chemo, I met a young girl who also _has Hodgkin_. Her name was Altagracia. We had a somehow… curious small conversation:

> — **Altagracia:** _how many years do you have attending the hospital?_
>
> — **Me:** _(years!?) I only have 3 months. And you?_
>
> — **Altagracia:** _I got Hodgkin 3 years ago… I was in remission until 2 months ago (which means she got Hodgkin twice)_
>
> — **Me:** 😳…
>
> — **Altagracia:** _I'm guilty here, I didn't take care of myself. I haven't eaten healthy during the remission period. Also, I didn't sleep well, I was going to bed late at night regularly…_

Indeed, **the lesson was learned: pay attention to your body**, do not let anything, anyone, push you in a way that doesn't respect your body, your life.

That reminds me that as someone who has a personal relationship with Jehovah God, the source of life, that if I really care about my spiritual relationship I have to honor Him by protecting my body, which is part of my life.
