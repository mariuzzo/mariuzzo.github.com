Today, I had an appointment with the hemato-oncologist to schedule the beginning of the treatment for the relapse of lymphoma. She asked if I could start tomorrow, December 3rd... but I speak about my veins that are not in good shape and lately I have had a lot of trouble finding a vein for blood draws. Therefore, she suggested placing a [**Port-a-Cath**](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/port-a-cath), which is a small medical device implanted under the skin that allows easy access to veins for blood draws and administering medications.
