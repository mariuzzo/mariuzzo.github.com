I went to the [haematologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology), and she examined my body. So far the swollen lymph nodes are located only on the right side of my neck.

She ordered 31 blood-related tests for me. And told me that the otorhinolaryngologist needs to extract one or more swollen lymph nodes from my neck for examination.
