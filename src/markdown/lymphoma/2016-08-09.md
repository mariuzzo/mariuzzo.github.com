Hey there! I'm fine and healthy. Tomorrow, I will get my 7th chemo of this treatment. I prepared a little sketch explaining everything about my treatment: **ABVD**. You can appreciate the 6 cycles, the 12 chemos, all the tests to be done after each cycles and some comments about the issue with the Vinblastine.

Tomorrow, I will update my blog with the experience and results of the 7th chemo. And maybe, a picture.
