Today I went for **surgery** ([Lymph node biopsy](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003933.htm)). The surgeon removed one of the swollen lymph nodes for testing. She recommended that I rest for 7 days and avoid sun exposure on that side for 2 months.

**Fun facts:** They gave me an anesthesia for children… and it knocked me out in less than 10 seconds. Later, when I tried to wake up, I fought for 30 minutes before I was able to clearly think and act.
