Finally, a week has been passed after my first chemo. That day, I didn't feel anything too strange on me. Now, I have the time to post an update about those other days!

## 1st day after the chemo

I felt really tired. The sensation on having something weird on my body was always on me during the whole day.

## 2nd day after the chemo

My skin started itching in different area in my whole body.

## 3rd day after the chemo

**This. was. the. worst.** I had nausea all the day. But, that nausea was not like a normal inclination to vomit what I had in the stomach, but I want to literally vomit my whole blood. Also, some odor stink to me like: olive oil, milk and sometime the air. It was very unpleasant.

I didn't vomit.

## 4th day after the chemo

Nauseas are still there, but seems like they were reducing. I understood why the doctor told me: “you will know what stuff you can eat during the chemo”. I was very picky regarding food. Potato, yuca, eggs, cherry were the main part of my diet this and the previous day.

## 5th day after the chemo

Yay! No more nauseas, but I still feel tired, my skin itch. That day, is the first day I decided to take a sun bath for 5 mins. I haven't been outside since the beginning of the chemo.

Ah! Something begun to be recurrent: one of my arms feels like burning. The one that was used for the chemo. After reading the comments about other patient that got Hodgkin and went for my same type of chemo, I see that an important number of them had their arm itching like burning. Looks like the “D” part of the ABVD chemo, the one that destroy the growth of cells is infamous because it use to burn the veins. So, looks like I'm another one with their vein burn.

## 6th day after the chemo

Ok, most of the symptoms are now gone! But my right arm still felt like burning. **Things are getting serious.** But, as far as it doesn't swell it is not something to worry too much. I heard among patients that a _Heating Pad_ helps a lot.

## 7th day after the chemo (today)

No fun at all with the burning arm. The pain woke me up twice last night. My wife had to put on my a warm woolen cloth. Then in the morning, we went to a pharmacy and purchased a _Heating Pad_. So good! Now it is bearable.

And that's it! That week was truly painful. Now, I understand why people say things like: “I'm fighting the cancer”. That's a true battle for a hope to survive.

Anyway, I have found truly comfort on those word:

> Jehovah will sustain him on his sickbed; During his sickness you will completely change his bed.
