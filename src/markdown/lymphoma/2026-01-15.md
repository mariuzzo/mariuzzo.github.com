Today, I had the [Port-a-Cath](/lymphoma/2026-01-07) implantation surgery. It went well. I am grateful for the medical team that took care of me.

The days before I was bit anxious, but felt calmness. I'm thankful to the prayers, the thoughts and the support of many.

In a couple of days I will be returning to the hospital to check the Port-a-Cath and to have the stitches removed.

My dear brother shared this thought with me:
