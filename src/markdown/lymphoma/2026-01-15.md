Today, I had the [Port-a-Cath](/lymphoma/2026-01-07) implantation surgery. It went well. I am grateful for the medical team that took care of me.

The days before I was bit anxious, but felt calmness. I'm thankful to the prayers, the thoughts and the support of many.

The day of the surgery, we arrived at the hospital at 6:00 AM. I was accompanied by some of my dear family: my wife, my little brother, my first daughter and her husband. The surgery started at 9:00 AM and left the hospital at 2:00 PM. By the time I left the hospital, I had two more friends waiting for me outside. I am grateful for their support and for Jehovah for giving me such wonderful people in my life.

In a couple of days I will be returning to the hospital to check the Port-a-Cath and to have the stitches removed.

My dear brother shared this thought with me:

> As for me, I panicked and said: \
> “I will perish from before you.” \
> But you heard my pleas for help when I cried out to you.
