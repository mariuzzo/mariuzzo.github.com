According to my schedule, I had to start the 5th cycle last week. Because of the suspicion of an ischemic event we had to delay it. After some tests, two doctors determined that I was able to continue.

Last week, I was worried and anxious. Not willing to continue. Trying to make up my mind between following the medical protocol for my condition and listening to my body. As I feel weaker each cycle, it is harder to endure and to distinguish known side effects from something else. Mimi, my wife, reminds me every time to live "**yon jou alafwa**" (which means "one day at a time", from a [song](https://www.jw.org/ht/bibliyotek/mizik-chan/chante/chak-jou-gen-pwop-pwoblem-pa-l/) in Haitian Creole).

Like every morning, Mimi and I have breakfast together, we read something positive out loud together, and we pray to Jehovah God together. We usually ask God to give us strength to endure, to protect us with His wisdom and to give us peace of mind. Today, the 1st day of the 5th cycle, I felt really calm and with peace of mind. There were some minor issues during chemo, but we remained calm the entire process. Didn't feel stressed like other days, didn't feel anxious either.

I thank Jehovah God first, because in these days He promises to "sustain" his loyals who are sick ([Psalm 41:3](https://www.jw.org/finder?wtlocale=E&pub=nwtsty&srctype=wol&bible=19041003&srcid=share)). In the future, things will be very different ([Isaiah 33:24](https://www.jw.org/finder?wtlocale=E&pub=nwtsty&srctype=wol&bible=23033024&srcid=share)). For now, I do everything I can to seek medical help, and I try to collaborate in multiple ways. I love life.

I appreciate the effort and goodwill of the medical team, nurses, concierge, med mixers, and more than I can even list. Sometimes we write them letters, or bring them some snacks, or we simply chat with them.
