title: 'Blood from veins in the foot'

This morning, I had blood tests for my upcoming doctor appointment. As my veins are damaged I expected the phlebotomist to have a hard time finding a proper vein. After 15 minutes, with two phlebotomists looking for a vein they suggested [arterial blood](/lymphoma/2021-08-05). My immediate reaction was: "No, no please" 🙅‍♂️. They examined my feet, and **they found a vein in my right foot**. First time having a blood sample extracted from a foot.
