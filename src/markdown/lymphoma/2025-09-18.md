In the previous months and years, I have been following doctors appointments for follow up. Recently, I had a PET scan and blood work done. The results were good –in my mind– but the doctor told us that **I rellapsed**. It is back again, in the neck area, where it was before [back in 2015](/lymphoma/2015-09-01/).

At least, the results showed that it is small (8.21mm). It can't be seen or felt. The doctor recommendation for treatment in my case is: chemotherapy and inmunotherapy. Back in 2016, I had chemotherapy (ABVD), and then in 2021 too (BEACOPP).

## The treatment

The treatment regimen will be: **K-GEMOX** every 21 days.

The K-GEMOX regimen consists of:

- Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) 200 mg IV on Day 1 (immunotherapy).
- Gemcitabine 1800 mg/m2 IV on Day 1 (chemotherapy).
- Oxaliplatin 180 mg/m2 IV on Day 1 (chemotherapy).
- Granisetron 3 mg IV on Day 1 (anti-nausea).

Note: IV stands for Intravenous, meaning the medication is administered directly into a vein.

## Goliath

![The Lion, The Bear and The Giant](/images/lymphoma/lion-bear-giant.png)

I'm calling it **"Goliath"**, not because it is big (although it is big to handle), but because it is the _third_ time I have to fight it. David fought against a lion, a bear, and then Goliath. So this is my _third_ fight. Therefore, with the same determination as David, I will fight it again with Jehovah's help.

> Jehovah, who rescued me from the claws of **the lion** and **the bear**, he is the one who will rescue me from the hand of this **Philistine** (Goliath).

[1 Sam. 17:37](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=09017037&pub=nwtsty).

Independent of the outcome, I know that Jehovah will always be with me, as he has been in the past with so many others.
