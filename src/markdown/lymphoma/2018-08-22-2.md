Yes, I'm still alive. I'm one of the privileged ones who can live after death.

I have visited the doctors several times since my last chemo, and she said there's no trace of Hodgkin. However, my body isn't the same. I still feel weak, have headaches, backaches, sore throat, pain in the mouth, pain in my right knee, an injury in the perineum and so on. Ah, I forgot to mention weird patterns on my tongue.

I don't want to think further as it steals my little energy that is in my body.
