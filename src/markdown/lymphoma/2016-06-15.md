And here we are again! Today, I want to share with you another one of the acute side effects of the [ABVD chemo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABVD) on me. As probably -or not- you may notice in these pictures I have several dark stains in some places such as fingers, hands and even arms. Yes, that's another side effect that's not serious, just cosmetic.

In the **first picture**, you can see where I got injected with the chemo last week. It is in the middle/center of the picture.

In the **second one**, if you pay attention to my right thumb you will see its normal tone in the bottom right… yes, that's it, what seems to be a light stain is actually my normal color, the rest is the effect of the chemo. Now, my hands look to me like they were dirty with mud.

And the **third picture** shows how the bottom of the nails in my thumbs has also become darker.

And that's all for now! I'm still feeling minor nauseas and some colics. I'm looking forward to the next chemo on Thursday 23rd this month.
