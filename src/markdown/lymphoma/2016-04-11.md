I returned to the Hospital. I came to do everything I could. I did all blood tests minus 2. Also, I had a _rendez-vous_ with the haematologist to have the bone marrow biopsy… **WHICH. I. DID. NOT. KNOW. WHAT. IT. WAS. ABOUT**​

I laid down in a bed and the haematologist picked a syringe that had like a 4-5mm diameter 😶 (look at the green syringe in the picture). I knew the bone marrow biopsy was about getting a piece of bone from my pelvis… but there was more…

She cleaned my skin, injected anesthesia and as she was explaining the procedure she added:

> "_…as you know the anesthesia doesn't have any effect on the bone…_"

and…

> “_…when I touch your pelvic bone I will make some pressure to get INTO the bone…_”

😱 I replied like in an infinite loop: "what, what what!? wait!". Obviously, she just continued. She was very good, it didn't hurt too, too, too much, but that thing is and feels scary. She literally punched several times the syringe into my pelvic bone, introduced another driller-like syringe into the big syringe to break apart the soft tissue of the bone and extract it… that's why they call it a biopsy.

I had my tomographies in the afternoon… that was super easy, not scary. Then I went home.

That day I paid: $0.
