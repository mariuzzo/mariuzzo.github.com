What a day! Today, I went to see my doctor. We started right away to schedule the first cycle of the chemotherapy. Tomorrow, I will start the first part of the first cycle, then on May 25 I will have the second part.

My wife and I made a few questions and got answers. So far here is the list of things that we need to pay attention to in this new life journey.

- **I should not eat fresh vegetables.** Instead, I can have them steamed.
- **I should not be in contact with sick people.** During treatment I will be one of the most vulnerable creatures… Regarding viruses, I will be in a Pokèmon state 'gotta catch 'em all'.
- **I should drink a lot of water.** Especially after I get the treatment applied.
- **I have to take some pills to protect my body.** We have to watch out for my little kidneys and my small stomach.

I'm glad we will finally start the treatment! Thanks Jehovah!

I'm one of the millions who are '_imagining the Time_', yes, [that Time](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=share&wtlocale=E&lank=pub-osg_16_VIDEO).
