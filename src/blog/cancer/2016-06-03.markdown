[Yesterday, I went to the lab for blood tests](http://gothodgkin.tumblr.com/post/145613458403/thursday-june-2nd-2016-today-i-will-have-my). Today, I got the results and I read them all. The relevant part is that my white cells, red cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit are above the reference range. Which mean I have a low blood count.

That's not something weird to me, because I had two chemos [IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy). The components of that chemo are irritant.

Let see what my doctor (the haematologist) says next Monday.
