Next Monday I will go to the Hospital and other centers to get the results of blood tests, the bone marrow biopsy, the tomographies and the echocardiogram. If I get them all then I have to schedule a visit with my haematologist.

Note: I can feel that my the swollen lymph nodes got bigger and larger by a few centimeters. And specially this week, I have been feeling more tired than usual. I have also been sleeping for more time than normal.
