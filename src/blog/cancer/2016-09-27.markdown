All right! Today was my 10th chemo! Got a few issues getting the Vincristine because it was out of stock at the hospital. We had drive to another hospital to buy it. Thanks Jehovah, we did it!

Apart from that, I learnt that Vinblastine is back on market, again. Let see, if I can reschedule a meeting with my doctor and see if we can get Vinblastine instead of Vincristine.

**Two more to go!**
