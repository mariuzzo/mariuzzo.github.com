Today I went for **surgery** ([Lymph node biopsy](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003933.htm)). She retired one of the swollen lymph nodes for test. The surgeron recommended me to rest for 7 days. And to not take sun on that side for 2 months.

**Fun facts:** They gave me an anaesthesia for childrenâ€¦ and it put me down in less than 10 seconds. Later, when I tried to woke up, and fought during 30 mins before I was capable to clearly think and act.
