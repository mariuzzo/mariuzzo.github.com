And here we are again! Today, I want to share with you another one of the acute side effects of the [ABVD chemo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABVD) on me. As probrably -or not- you may notice in these picture I have several dark stain in some places such as fingers, hand and even arm. Yes, that's another side effect that's not serious, just cosmetic.

In the **first picture**, you can see where I got injected with the chemo last week. It is in the middle/center of the picture.

In the **second one**, if you pay attention at my right thumb you will its normal tone in the bottom rightâ€¦ yes, that's it, what seems to be a ligth stain is actually my normal color, the rest is the effect of the chemo. Now, my hands looks to me like they were dirty with mud.

And the **third picture** shows how the bottom of the nails in my thumbs has also became darker.

And that's all for all! I'm still feeling with minor nauseas and with some colics. I'm looking forward for the next chemo on Thursday 23rd this month.
