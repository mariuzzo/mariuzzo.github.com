Today, we had our doctor appointment. The doctor and the committee confirmed the evidence: **the cancer is back**. They recommended a more aggressive chemotherapy regimen called [BEACOPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BEACOPP). But first, they need to run a few tests for: blood, viruses, vitamin D and creatinine. Also, I have to get an echography. All this to determine if my body is strong enough to support this different treatment.
