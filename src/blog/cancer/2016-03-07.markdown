I went for the sonography to verify if there’s any other internal organs that look suspicious.

I got the results 20 minutes after the procedure. So far, everything inside me looks OK. 

 - ✔ Pancreas.
 - ✔ Liver.
 - ✔ 2 x Kidney.
 - ✔ Bladder.
 - ✔ Gallbladder.
 - ✔ Appendix.
 - ✔ Prostate.

So far, so good.
