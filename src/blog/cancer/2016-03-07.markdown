I went for the sonography to verify if there’s any other internal organs that look suspicious.

I got the results 20 minutes after the procedure. So far, everything inside me looks OK.

- ✔ Pancreas.
- ✔ Liver.
- ✔ 2 x Kidney.
- ✔ Bladder.
- ✔ Gallbladder.
- ✔ Appendix.
- ✔ Prostate.

So far, so good.
