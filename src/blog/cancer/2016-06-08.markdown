<!-- TODO: Add video. -->

Today, I accomplished a goal: **injecting myself with Filgrastim**. My wife was excited to also inject me, but in the end I was more excited and I decide to put it myself. And, in case of emergency (losing consciousness) she will make it instead.

In the video, you will my “brave” and “manly” reaction 😂.
