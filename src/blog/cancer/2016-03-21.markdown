## I'm not dead, just laying down for the picture and to show off

Finally, I removed the cover. It looks OK to me and the doctor. My dermis doesn't heal pretty, but that incision looks very good. It doesn't hurt, I still have the numbness effect of the anaesthesia under the lobe if my ear.

When I feel better then I will get an haircut + shave.
