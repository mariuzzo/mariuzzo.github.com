It has been a while since the last time I wrote. On Monday 11th, I had my 5th chemo and I started to Vincristine instead of Vinblastine. After that I had the common side effects of the chemo. Although, the Vincristine seems to be more adverse causing a weird taste in mouth for at least a week. Anyway, since 3 days ago I have been feeling better, but not for so long, next Tuesday I will have my 6th chemo.
