## Day 1 of first chemo from 2nd cycle (third chemo)

Today, I woke up at 7:00 AM. I felt really better; relaxed and full of energy. I did my usual routine for the first 3 days of a dose of chemotherapy which consist of some meds to protect my stomach and my kidneys.

I'm really thankful to Jehovah God, my spectacular wife: Mimi, and my two mothers.
