On Monday 22nd I had another appointment with my doctor appointment. She explained to us that the recommended treatment protocol will be adapted to my case.

The recommended protocol for me is BEACOPP which is usually administered in cycles of 21 days. There's a more intensive regimen with cycles of 14 days. **In my case it will be cycles of 28 days**.

Also, in any of theses cycles the days 1, 2, 3 and 8 the patient need to go to the hospital for IV drugs and from days 1-14 take oral drugs at home. All these aforementioned drugs are cytotoxic parts of the chemotherapy. **In my case, I will only take oral drugs from days 1-4.**

Finally, the BEACOPP treatment, where each letter is a drug, consists of 7 drugs: 5 IVs and 2 oral drugs. **In my case, I will get all IVs and just one of the oral drugs for a few days.**
