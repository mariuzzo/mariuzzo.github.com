Today, I had another appointment with my doctor. She explained to us that **the recommended treatment protocol will be adapted to my case**.

The recommended protocol for me is **[BEACOPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BEACOPP)** which is usually administered in cycles of 21 days. There's a more intensive regimen with cycles of 14 days. **In my case it will be cycles of 28 days**.

Also, in any of theses cycles the days 1, 2, 3 and 8 the patient need to go to the hospital for IV drugs and from days 1-14 take oral drugs at home. **In my case, I will only take oral drugs from day 1-4.**

Finally, the **[BEACOPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BEACOPP)** treatment, where each letter is a drug, consists of: 5 IVs and 2 oral tablets. **In my case, I will get all IVs and just one of the oral drugs for a few days.**
