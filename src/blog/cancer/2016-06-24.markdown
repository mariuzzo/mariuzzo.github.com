Today, I went for my 4th dose of [ABVD chemo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABVD). Unfortunately, the Vinblastine (V from ABVD) was out of stock, butâ€¦ there was only one 10mg bottle and I needed 6mg. Thanks to Jehovah that I got it for me. But, as I said, â€˜unfortunatelyâ€™ for any other person that would that same kind of medicine for today. I asked the nurse what would happen if in a next dose, there's one component missing. She explained multiple way of getting it via fundations or other hospital. Ouf! I'm prepared in case it affect us again.

About this dose, **it was the best**, almost no pain, no freeze, no fever, all good! I just got more dark stain in my hands and feets. As a said, that's just a cosmetic side effect. Nothing to worry about. ðŸ˜›

Now, I'm writing this from home. I'm feeling normal, just a little bit of fatigue, nothing serious. I have already drink 2L of water, and I will continue for the rest of the night. **Drinking a lot water is a way to protect my body, by doing this I'm forcing my system to drain the toxicity of the chemo cocktail.**

That's it for today! Last thing, today I was reading these confortable words: 

 > **Psalm 46:1:** God is our refuge and strength,
A help that is readily found in times of distress.
