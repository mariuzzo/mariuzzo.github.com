I got my first visit to the new public hospital. I had a _rendez-vous_ with a new haematologist. Everything went great. 

Thanks to Jehovah that I found a spiritual sister in that Hospital fighting with a stage II breast cancer. She had a positive attitude which encouraged me and give me some hints […] 

When I went to see the haematologist, she suggested me the same treatment as the other one (that’s was good sign!). Later, she indicated me 3 tests to determine the stage of my illness:

 1. Several blood tests.
 2. A Bone marrow biopsy.
 3. Four tomographies. 

Before leaving she told me that I have a “good” diagnosis, meaning that my illness have a good response to current treatments compared to other cancers. 

Also, she asked me about my insurance (months ago I mysteriously discovered that I have government subsidised insurance apart from my private one) then I told her that I have a government subsidised insurance (the same as my sis), then she replied: 

> “Ok, it covers the costs of the treatment up to 100% including  tests, studies and medications”. 😍

You don't need to ask me how relieved I felt and I keep feeling because of these words. In my family, I'm the only one who work to get money, because both my wife and I work as volunteers. Thanks God!

After that we went home… That day I paid: $0.
