Today, I continue with the remaining tests:

 - ðŸ‘Œ 2 blood tests. 
 - ðŸ‘Œ Pending coprologica. ðŸ’©
 - ðŸ‘Œ An echocardiogram (the doctor said my heart looks OK).

I have 3 holes in each arms because of injections ðŸ˜‚. I will drink a lot of beet juice (I heard often that red-natural drinks are good for blood). 

My pelvic bone still hurt a little, the doctor said that I would feel pain for 2-3 days. It feels like my bone was fractured.
