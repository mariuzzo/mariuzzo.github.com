I returned to the Hospital. I came to do everything I could. I did all blood tests minus 2. Also, I had _rendez-vous_ with the haematologist to have the bone marrow biopsy… **WHICH. I. DID. NOT. KNOW. WHAT. IT. IS. ABOUT**​

I laid down in a bed and the haematologist picked a syringe that had like 4-5mm of diameter 😶 (looks at the green syringe in the picture). I knew the bone marrow biopsy was about getting a piece of bone from my pelvis… but there was more…

She cleaned my skin, injected anaesthesia and as she was explaining the prodecure she added:

> “_…as you know the anaesthesia doesn’t have any effect to the bone…_”

and…

> “_…when I touch your pelvic bone I will make some pressure to get INTO the bone…_”

😱 I replied like in a infinite loop: “what, what what!? wait!”. Obviously, she just continued. She was very good, it didn't hurt too, too, too much, but that things is and feels scary. She literally punched several times the syringe into my pelvic bone, introduced another driller-like syringe into the big syringe to break a part of the soft tissue of the bone and extract it… that’s why they call that a biopsy.

I had my tomographies in the afternonn… that was super easy, no scary. Then I went home.

That day I paid: $0.
