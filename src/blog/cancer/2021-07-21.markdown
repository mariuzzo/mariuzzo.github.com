title: "1st day, 5th cycle"

<p>According to my schedule, I had to start the 5th cycle last week. Because, of the suspicion of an ischemic event we had to delayed it. After some tests two doctors determined that I was able to continue.</p><p>Last week, I was worried and anxious. Not willing to continue. Trying to make my mind between following the medical protocol for my condition and to listen to my body. As I feel weaker each cycle, it is harder to endure and to distinguish known side effects and something else. Mimi, my wife, reminds me everytime to live "<b>yon jou alafwa</b>" (which mens "one day at a time", from a <a href="https://www.jw.org/ht/bibliyotek/mizik-chan/chante/chak-jou-gen-pwop-pwoblem-pa-l/">song</a> in Haitian Creole).</p><p>Like every morning, Mimi and I have breakfast together, we read something positive out loud together, and we pray Jehovah God together. We usually ask God to give us strength to endure, to protect us with His wisdom and to give us peace of mind. Today, the 1st day of the 5th cycle, I felt really calm and with peace of mind. There were some minor issues during chemo, but we remained calm the entire process. Didn't felt stressed like other days, didn't felt anxious neither.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="810" data-orig-width="1080"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/4f616a17dc8ec372fc7c0c53dc4421c3/068540dbd4f52a7a-22/s640x960/06fec5de5acc3e00b77deea9e053070eeff1d8ab.jpg" data-orig-height="810" data-orig-width="1080"></figure><p>I thank Jehovah God first, because in these days He promise to "sustain" his loyals that are sick (<a href="https://www.jw.org/finder?wtlocale=E&amp;pub=nwtsty&amp;srctype=wol&amp;bible=19041003&amp;srcid=share">Psalm 41:3</a>).

For now, I do everything I can to seek for medical help, and I try to collaborate in multiple ways. I love life.</p><p>I appreciate the effort and goodwill of the medical team, nurses, concierge, meds mixers, and more that I can even list. Sometimes we wrote them letters, or bring them something snack, or we simply chat with them.</p>
