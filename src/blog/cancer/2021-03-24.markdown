As documented before, for my diagnosis the doctor took out the **P** (for **P**rocarbazine) from my treatment. On the 1st day of each cycle I will be taking **EAC** (cytotoxic drugs) intravenously (1 hour each) and **P** (for **P**rednisone) orally in a 75mg tablet.

## How was my day in the hospital?

We arrived at 8:00am, but the treatment started by 2:00pm. We finished by 5:30pm. The reason for the morning delay, is because all treatment cubicles were already in use (there are 12 cubicle at the hospital) and we were put in a queue. During the queue I told Mimi a bad joke, that was so bad that she had an uncontrollable laugh (we both cried laughing; I don't remember the joke sorry ðŸ˜“).

## Post Mortem

At the hospital, I felt **regular**. I drove back home and was feeling **uncomfortable**. And when I arrived I felt a bit dizzy like floating, heart rate increased a bit and had a headach. I felt **horrible** inside, but nothing serious.

I didn't had appetite, but I ate half of a chicken soup. Then I took the **P** (Prednisone) at home by 8:00pm. Didn't feel any change in my body. Later by 9:30pm had the other half of the soup, ate a slice of bread with peanut butter and lemon jam. Also, during the day I drank a lot of water so I could excret the toxicity of the drugs ASAP.

We went to bed by 10:00pm, woke up a 1:00am because my bladder told so, and had a good night sleep until 5:30am.
