title: Fine & Tired

Today, I feel fine. A little bit tired because of being all day in bed during the last week. My arm still hurt a bit, particularly my hand. I have noticed that if I make some kind of movements with my hand it hurt and I immediate feel the burn coming. Stuff as scratching my body makes my affected hand tired.

However, I'm feeling good! My wife and I have being more focused on living even more healthy, having a reasonable balance.

These days I'm using a medical face mask when I open a window or when I go outside to take a sun bath.
