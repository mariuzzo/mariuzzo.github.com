<p>Today, was a good day. After two failed attempts to find a proper vein, the third was a success. The personnel did the best they could, but my veins are too affected by the accumulated doses.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="4000" data-orig-width="3000"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/71fd4b8f3a36065951b58eff7277b45e/c2bd96a02e9c17f3-72/s640x960/31e2c823beeac4af1b041e8d169f5a8bf296067b.jpg" data-orig-height="4000" data-orig-width="3000"></figure><p>At night, by 4am I woke up as usual to go to the restroom. When I tried to flex my left leg I felt a pain. I checked my whole leg trying to find something irregular, also punched to find a sensitive spot, but nothing was found. I visually compared both legs and everything seems similar. I suspect it is the CIPN (Chemotherapy Induced Peripheral Neuropathy).</p><p>My current treatment (BEACOPP without Procarbazine) contains two cytotoxic drugs that are known to cause CIPN. These drugs are: Etoposide and Vincristine. The former is administered the first three days in a cycle, while the latter is given on the eighth day.</p><p>Overall, as I said at the beginning it was a good day. Another time, I felt Jehovah accompanied us and protected us with his wisdom. His wisdom make us remember how to act and collaborate with all the personnel and that creates a peaceful atmosphere. Also, He give me the strength to continue with this aggressive treatment, which I constantly think to quit.</p>
