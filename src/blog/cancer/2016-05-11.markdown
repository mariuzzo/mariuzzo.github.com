Today was **my first chemotherapy!** I was anxious to get it. I was told that it would take around 6 hours to get the application. It turned out that it took only 4 hours from 9:00 to 13:00.

After the chemotherapy, I was feeling OK. Just a little bit full of fluids. In the next minutes I came to feel a weakness in my body. When I arrived home, I slept a couple of hours. I think those are the immediate consequences.

Right now, it is 23:20, and I still weak and some inconveniences in different part of my body, which I assume to be normal as I read. I will do my best to keep this blog updated. 

Thanks Jehovah!
