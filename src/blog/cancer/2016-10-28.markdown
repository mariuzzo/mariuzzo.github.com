I'm glad to announce that **I completed the last chemo** from the last session.

It was a loooong (more than 6 months) journey with up and down. I learnt so much about myself and life. I felt the hand of Jehovah God between all the processes, not only because I finished, but because the strength I had to endure all of this with a real positive attitude.

Now, I will be able to join my congregation physically after 1 month from now. Also, during the next 3 months my doctors will check on me if the cancer is really gone, or if it returns.
