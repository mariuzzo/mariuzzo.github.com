I apologize for not keeping my word on having this blog updated daily since my [2nd chemotherapy](http://gothodgkin.tumblr.com/post/144941975578/2nd-chemo). I was completely distracted with the “friendly” side effects of the chemo.

Basically, I had the same mix of [side effects](http://gothodgkin.tumblr.com/post/144523208178/tuesday-may-17-2016-finally-a-week-has-been) as the first one. I have to admit, this 2nd round of chemo was more easy to manage than the first one. The side effects were the same except that I felt less burning in my right arm.
