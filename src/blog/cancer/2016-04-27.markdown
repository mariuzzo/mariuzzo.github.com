As scheduled, I returned to the haematology today. I came to obtain the indication of the treatment which will consist on [ABVD chemotherapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABVD). ABVD is the first-line treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma.

The treatment is divided on 6 cycles of 28 days. On each cycle, day 1st and 15th will be the days that I will received the ABVD chemotherapy regimen, then I will rest until the 28th. We can say that I will get a dose of chemotherapy fortnightly.

Now, I have to wait 5-7 working days for the approval of the insurance. Then we will start the fight! ðŸ’ª
