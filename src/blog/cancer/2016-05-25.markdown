Today, I went to the hospital to get my 2nd dose on chemotherapy. The nurse was nice and asked me about the reactions on 1st chemo. Then we agreed to slow down the [Dacarbazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacarbazine) component which was the culprit to burnt my veins. Instead of introducing that component in 1 hour we did it in 2 hours. That was really relieving, I didn't feel the burn or itch while it was invading my blood vessels.

I drove to the hospital with the best companion: my wife. My mother and my step-father came to visit us. Also, my father-in-law came to drive me back home safely. It is really valuable when our family relationships are strong as they are. It feels like receiving courage and love ♥️.

Finally, when I arrive home I felt better than after the 1st chemo. I have the sensation on having something on my body that's not me (obviously). Again, I will start drinking around 4 liter of water and/or juice to drain all these chemical out. That way, I reduce the [crazy effects of the ABVD chemo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABVD#Side_effects).

**I will try to post an update daily during the first of my first chemo.** Stay tuned!
