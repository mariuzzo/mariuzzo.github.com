Mimi took my temperature and <strong>I was having a fever of 38.5C</strong> (101.3F) 🤒. I took <em>painkillers</em> to control the fever and wait a couple of minutes. After 20 minutes, <strong>the fever went to 39.0C</strong> (102.2F). We decided to call ER oncology. The conversation over the phone was:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mimi:</strong> I have a patient that had chemo 8 days ago and is having a fever of 39.0C.</li>\n<li><strong>ER:</strong> He should come here. However, there are a lot of patients in queue. But he should come anyway.</li>\n<li><strong>Mimi:</strong> Can we visit another ER (non oncology)?</li>\n<li><strong>ER:</strong> No, cancer patients are only treated here.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With no <em>‘many’</em> options, a neighbor came to brought us to the ER oncology. Before leaving, <strong>the fever went to 39.5C</strong> (103.1F). We arrived in less than 30 mins. At the ER, every cubicles were full and 2 other patients were in queue waiting for attention. A couple of minutes after arriving, a nurse came asking about the <em>‘patient with the fever’</em>. She did a few routine checks on me, and took my temperature. It was 39.5C (103.1F).</p>\n<p>One fair disadvantage that I have is that I'm usually the younger looking among others patients. The 2 other patients that were before me, was a lady in her sixties in a wheelchair and there was a man in his seventy also in a wheelchair. And I was there walking. For us, it is normal, understandable and considerate to let older patient be attended before me.</p>\n<p>Mimi and me wasn't alone. My mother, my step-dad and my parents in law were there supporting us 🥰. I felt very grateful to have all of them with us.</p>\n<h2>Inside the ER cubicle</h2>\n<p>After 2 hours, I was admitted to the ER. By that time, <strong>the fever went down to 38.0C</strong> (100.4F) approx. The doctor and nurse ran more checks on me. Then a nurse inserted an intravenous catheter into one of my veins and then administered <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol\">Paracetamol</a> (a medication used to treat fever). Because my veins are damaged, the drip was super slow.</p>\n<p>A couple of minutes later, a phlebotomist appeared to extract blood from my veins. However, after looking for a proper vein she couldn't find any. At that moment, the phlebotomist told the doctor that she would proceed to extract <strong>arterial blood</strong> and she repeated that to me. I didn't understand that wasn't just a message, but a warning. She punctured my body 5 times to be able to get an arterial blood sample. Most of these punctures were painful.</p>\n<p>In the end, everything went fine at the ER. After examining my blood <strong>they prescribed a treatment for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Febrile_neutropenia\">febrile neutropenia</a></strong>. It consisted of 3 days of: painkillers, antibiotics and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filgrastim\">Filgrastim</a> (a medication used to treat low neutrophil count). Also, I didn't get admitted to the hospital, they allowed me to go home that same day. We left around 11:00pm.</p>\n<h2>About arterial blood</h2>\n<p>A few days later, I did some research about <strong>\"arterial blood\"</strong>. The motivation was to understand if the pain that I experienced was to be expected. The <a href=\"https://www.ucsfhealth.org/medical-tests/arterial-stick\"><abbr title=\"University of California San Francisco\">UCSF</abbr> says</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Puncture of an artery may be more uncomfortable than puncture of a vein.</strong> This is because arteries are deeper than veins. Arteries also have thicker walls and have more nerves.</p>\n<p>When the needle is inserted, there may be some discomfort or pain. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That was enough to be convinced that the pain that I experienced was to be expected. Also, I think the <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/cancer/neuropathy-from-chemo\"><abbr title=\"Chemotherapy-induced Peripheral Neuropathy\">CIPN</abbr></a> increased the pain, because of the damage to peripheral nerves. But I'm not a doctor. I will ask my doctor about it at my next appointment.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2021-08-05T19:07:42.000Z","slug":"/lymphoma/2021-08-05","title":"First ER visit & arterial blood"}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2015-09-01"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-03-03"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-03-04"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-03-05"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-03-07"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-03-10"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-03-17"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-03-18"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-03-21"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-03-25"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-03-29"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-04-06"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-04-08"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-04-11"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-04-13"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-04-23"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-04-24"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-04-25"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-04-27"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-05-06"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-05-10"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-05-11"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-05-17"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-05-19"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-05-25"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-06-01"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-06-02"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-06-03"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-06-06"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-06-08"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-06-10-2"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-06-10"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-06-12"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-06-15"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-06-23"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-06-24"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-07-05"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-07-12-2"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-07-12"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-07-23"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-07-27"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-08-09"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-08-10"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-08-25"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-09-09"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-09-12"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-09-27"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-10-12"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-10-28"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/code/guide-create-a-node-js-command-line-package"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2018-08-22-2"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2018-08-22"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/code/remove-old-node-modules-directories"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2020-12-22"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2021-02-24"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2021-03-01"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2021-03-22"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2021-03-24"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2021-05-15"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2021-05-17"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2021-06-17"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2021-07-21"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2021-08-05"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2021-08-21"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2021-08-23"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2025-09-18"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2025-12-02"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"32e8f8b5-6959-5467-94fb-79805b8d9054","frontmatter__slug":"/lymphoma/2021-08-05","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"lymphoma"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2052298874"],"slicesMap":{}}
