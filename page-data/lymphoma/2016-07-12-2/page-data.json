Two weeks ago, when we went for the 4th dose there was a problem with one of the chemotherapy components (vinblastine). Today, there was no <em>Vinblastine</em> at all in the hospital, neither in other hospitals, foundations, pharmacies, or pharmaceuticals. <em>Vinblastine</em> Apocalypse! There was no V in the whole country… Of course, we spent the whole morning looking for it, my both families too, also the doctor and nurses. I don't need to say more; <em>Vinblastine</em> seems to be gone here. My doctor pointed out the following history fact:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the past there was a Vinblastine crisis that lasted 2 years…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>ಠ_ಠ ← That was exactly my face.</p>\n<p>It was 12PM already. At that time I was supposed to be finishing with the dose, but I hadn't even started it. Then the doctor says that we could replace the <em>Vinblastine</em> with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincristine\">Vincristine</a>. Nice, a new flavor for the cocktail!</p>\n<p>We went to eat something, then we purchased the <em>Vincristine</em> (because it wasn't under the insurance approval). Having everything, we started the chemo at 3PM and we finished 5hrs later… 7PM. That's what I call a day!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I'm very grateful that we were able to find a viable alternative. I'm thinking about people in other places in this world who can't get any of these treatments… I'm thinking like that not because I have Hodgkin, but because I have seen the good will of some people like my personal doctor and the nurses, and I have also seen the reality of new things. For example, the doctor explained that one possible reason that we don't have <em>Vinblastine</em> is because it is one of the cheapest meds, and pharmaceuticals don't sell too much. Yes, that sucks! I know they are not a charity institute, they are a business. But we are all humans.</p>\n<p>Anyway, focusing on the bad things will not solve anything. I decided to focus my attention on how things went well for us. I strongly believe that Jehovah God had a role in this, because He has helped me to have a good attitude towards things in life. And many scientists and doctors have proved that a good attitude has a good influence on us. We, my wife and I, also proved that <a href=\"https://www.jw.org/finder?docid=102016002&#x26;wtlocale=E&#x26;srcid=share\">attitude makes a difference</a>!</p>\n<p>I would like to conclude this post with a Bible proverb that states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“A joyful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit saps one’s strength.” (<a href=\"https://www.jw.org/en/publications/bible/nwt/books/proverbs/17/#v20017022\">Proverbs 17:22</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"date":"2016-07-12T01:22:35.000Z","slug":"/lymphoma/2016-07-12-2","title":"5th chemo: Monday, July 11th, 2016"}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2015-09-01"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-03-03"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-03-04"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-03-05"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-03-07"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-03-10"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-03-17"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-03-18"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-03-21"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-03-25"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-03-29"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-04-06"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-04-08"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-04-11"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-04-13"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-04-23"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-04-24"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-04-25"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-04-27"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-05-06"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-05-10"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-05-11"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-05-17"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-05-19"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-05-25"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-06-01"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-06-02"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-06-03"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-06-06"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-06-08"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-06-10-2"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-06-10"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-06-12"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-06-15"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-06-23"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-06-24"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-07-05"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-07-12-2"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-07-12"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-07-23"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-07-27"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-08-09"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-08-10"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-08-25"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-09-09"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-09-12"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-09-27"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-10-12"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2016-10-28"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/code/guide-create-a-node-js-command-line-package"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2018-08-22-2"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2018-08-22"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/code/remove-old-node-modules-directories"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2020-12-22"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2021-02-24"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2021-03-01"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2021-03-22"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2021-03-24"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2021-05-15"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2021-05-17"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2021-06-17"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2021-07-21"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2021-08-05"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2021-08-21"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2021-08-23"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2025-09-18"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/lymphoma/2025-12-02"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b1dddc4-ff5d-5d63-801e-105bae314c30","frontmatter__slug":"/lymphoma/2016-07-12-2","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"lymphoma"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2052298874"],"slicesMap":{}}
